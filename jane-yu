Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        <h1> ~ <h6>, <p>, <ul>, <li>... are block elements, they take the available full width.
        <a>, <span>... are inline elements, they take only the required width, these elements do not start with a new line.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        The positioning is done relative to the first relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent element. For example, the parent element has the position set to relative. And now, when you set the position of the child element to absolute, any additional positioning will be done relative to the parent element.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        Using width, max-width and margin: auto;


    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Diplay block by default: <p>, <h1>, <li>
        Display inline: <span>, <a>
        Display inline-block by default: <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
        Every element in HTML can be considered as a box, and we can adject something for the box.
        If I use position:fixed, the box gonna be fixed at the same position, even we scroll.
